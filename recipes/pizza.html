        <h3><strong>Steps to cook</strong></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. 
                        Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. 
                        Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.
                         You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
                    
                         <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. 
                        Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
                   
                        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. 
                        On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
                        The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.
                         Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
                    
                         <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. 
                            Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. 
                            Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. 
                            Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. 
                            Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. 
                            Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. 
                            Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. 
                            Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
